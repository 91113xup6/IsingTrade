When faced with large amount of informations, algorithmic implemented in computer programs can help traders analyze them and improve trading strategy.

# So what is IsingTrade?

IsingTrade combines physics and algorithmic trading to teach students about solid state physics models and algorithmic trading at the same time. Or at least give them a feeling about these stuff.
