In Ising model, an array of electrons fluctuate according to the laws of quantum mechanics. This is useful in explaining the origin of magnetism.

## Algorithmic Trading

When faced with large amount of informations, algorithms implemented in computer programs can help traders analyze them and improve trading strategy.

# So what is IsingTrade?

IsingTrade combines physics and algorithmic trading to teach students about solid state physics models and algorithmic trading at the same time. Or at least give them a feeling about these stuff.
